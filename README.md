# Brackeys-Jam

### **INSTRUCTIONS**
If you've never used github before, or just need help setting up the github repository for the project (No shame), here is a much more in-depth tutorial by **[Brackeys](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qpXxcvS-g3g)**.

1. Clone this repository into your Projects folder. 
2. Once you clone this repository to your PC, navigate to your local copy of README.md and set your status from [PENDING] to [PRESENT] at the bottom of this file -- Then, commit your changes to Master. This is to test communication between the client and the remote server.

  > (When the game jam starts and the objective is formally decided, an administrator will initialize a unity project within this repository. Don't panic if it's still empty.)

We will be using Feature branches for new work -- For more, see [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aJnFGMclhU8).

**Ensure you are using Github Desktop.**

**Ensure you have Unity 2019.4.0f1 (LTS).**
