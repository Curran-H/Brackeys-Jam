# Brackeys-Jam

### **INSTRUCTIONS**
If you've never used github before, or just need help setting up the github repository for the project (no shame), click here for a much more in-depth tutorial by *[Brackeys](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qpXxcvS-g3g)*.

1. Clone this repository into your Projects folder. 
2. Once you clone this repository to your PC, navigate to your local copy of README.md and set your status from [PENDING] to [PRESENT] at the bottom of this file -- Then, commit your changes to Master. This is to test communication between the client and the remote server.

  > (When the game jam starts and the objective is formally decided, an administrator will initialize a unity project within this repository. Don't panic if it's still empty.)

We will be using Feature branches for new work -- PLEASE make sure you know what you're doing! If you don't know about these yet, and need to learn more, please see *[here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aJnFGMclhU8)*. We will be using a watered down version of the Git flow.  When you begin working towards a new feature, construct a new branch clearly named for its purpose.  When you complete the feature, open a pull request; A project administrator will review it, and merge it into the development branch, if what they see is good.

**Ensure you are using Github Desktop.**

**Ensure you have Unity 2019.4.0f1 (LTS).**
