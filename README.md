# [Brackeys-Jam](https://itch.io/jam/brackeys-4)

### **INSTRUCTIONS**
If you've never used github before, or just need help setting up the github repository for the project (no shame), click here for a much more in-depth tutorial by *[Brackeys](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qpXxcvS-g3g)*.

1. Clone this repository into your Projects folder. 
2. Once you clone this repository to your PC, navigate to your local copy of README.md and set your status from [PENDING] to [PRESENT] at the bottom of this file -- Then, commit your changes to Master. This is to test communication between the client and the remote server.

  > (When the game jam starts and the objective is formally decided, an administrator will initialize a unity project within this repository. Don't panic if it's still empty.)

## DO NOT PUSH YOUR COMMITS TO THE MASTER BRANCH!!!!

*We will be using Feature branches for new work -- PLEASE make sure you know what you're doing! If you don't know about these (workflow strategies) yet, and need to learn more, please watch this quick informational video [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aJnFGMclhU8). We will be using a watered down version of the Git flow.  When you begin working towards a new feature, construct a new branch clearly named for its purpose.  When you complete the feature, open a pull request; A project administrator will review it, and merge it into the development branch for you, if what they see is good.*

### How we decide our concepts

Each team member is responsible for inventing and presenting ***two*** game concepts (Please don't leave these half-baked; Actually prime them for presentation and think them through) as soon as they can from the announcement of the theme. From those games, we will each pick our favorite (one each), and start making the hard decisions between those, putting the rest away.  

To decide which one concept to pursue, first we will look at resources (Complexity and Time) for the two primary disciplines of Art and Code.  After deciding which is closest to our maximum "budget," we'll move to the competition's criteria -- This will vary between game jams, but common things to look out for are points for "Theme," "Sound," "Aesthetics," etc, etc -- And whatever we decide has the highest potential to be executed with a high ranking should be our choice.

### When to use "Issues"

The first day of game jams is typically used as a "Planning period," but I realize that ideas aren't the kind of thing you turn off.

...and neither are bugs.

So, at the top of the Github repository (WEBSITE ONLY), if you navigate to the Issues tab, you can make ideas suggestions after the planning period (Or toward the latter half of the game jam, report bugs).
